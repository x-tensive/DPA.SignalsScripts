Script is used for classification of adjustment downtime periods. Only periods during which workcenter parameters satisfy condition are classified. 
You can customise conditions and downtime reason name in CommonScriptAdjustmentDowntime.cs file (see attached comments). 
Make sure that downtime reasons are created in reference book with same names as in CommonScriptAdjustmentDowntime.cs
